            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Sacraments ſignified longe agoe from the time of Melchizedech, come forth, and to the children of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, doing his workes, the higheſt Preiſt bringeth forth bread &amp; wyne. <hi>This is (ſaith he) my body.</hi> They had eate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; drunk of the ſame bread according to the viſible forme, but before thoſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, that common meate was onely fit to noriſh the body, and miniſtred helpe to the corporal life, but after it was ſaid of our lord: <hi>Do this in my commemorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, This is my fleſh,</hi> &amp; <hi>this is my bloud.</hi> So often as with theſe wordes, and this faith, the matter is ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dled, that ſuperſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:23796:22"/> bread, and Chalice conſecrated by ſolemne benediction, doth profit to the life and ſaluation of the whole man, both a medicine, and holocauſt to heale our infirmities &amp; purge iniquities.</p>
                  <p>The bread which our Lord gaue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Diſciples, cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged not in outward ſhew, but in nature, by the omnipote<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the word, is made fleſh. And as in the perſon of Chriſt, the humanity was ſeene, and the diuinity lay hid: So the diuine eſſenſe vnſpeakably, haith infuſed it ſelf to the viſible ſacrament. As the comon bread which we daily eat is the life of the body: ſo this ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantial bread, is the life of the ſoule and health of the minde.</p>

Wherefore when thou art to pray, do not preſently fal to petition, otherwaies thou art an eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to thy wil, that thou makeſt not thy praiers vnto god, vntil by neceſſity thou be vrged vnto it. Therfore when ſoeuer thou art determined to pray, forſake wife, children, and thy ſelf al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, and depart farre from thinges of the earth; climbe aboue the heauen, and leaue behinde thee al creatures viſible, and inuiſible, and begin with glorifiing him, that created al thinges. And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou haſt ſufficiently reſted on him, ſay as foloweth.</p>
                  <p>I geue thankes vnto thee o Lord, for thy incredible clemency and gentlenes, in bearing with the offences of men, who ſuffereſt me that ſinneth daily, and geueſt power to vs al, to amend our liues. For this is the cauſe for which thou art ſilent, and ſpareſt vs o Lord, that we ſhould geue thankes vnto thee,

And firſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt viſit vs by thy Prophets, and laſtly by the coming of thy Chriſt. For thou haſt framed vs, and not we our ſelues, thou art our god.</p>
                  <p>And when thou haſt ſufficiently ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen thankes, and glorified god, with praiſes of holy Scripture, then againe with humility begin and ſay.</p>
                  <p>I am not worthy o Lord, to ſpeake before thee becauſe I am excedingly a ſinner. And although to thy ſelf thou art guilty of no ſinne, yet it behoueth thee ſo to ſay. For ſeing that in many <note place="margin">

By and by with like art and facility, of the duſt of the earth, thou framedſt man, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to thine Image and ſimilitude, and being made a litle meaner then Angels and adorned with free wil, thou haſt appointed him King and Lord, of al created thinges, that he might enioy thoſe good thinges, which thou hadſt prepared for him in paradiſe, which he alſo ſo long enioyed, vntil ſnared &amp; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the ſerpent &amp; wife, he broke thy diuine commaundements, in eating the apple of the deadly tree: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he preſently fel from his kingly dig<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nity, and ſhutte forth of paradiſe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred puniſhment worthy his deedes, that is, into weping, and ſeruile beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, into ſweat, labour, and greife, into ſadneſſe and ſorow, and which is truly the moſt bitter of al puniſhments, at laſt, into iuſtly deſerued death, and diſſolution into earth, from which, he

                  <p>But thou o Lord, truly gentle and merciful, dideſt not deſpiſe that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, which aboue al deare vnto thee, the deuils tyranny had oppreſſed.</p>
                  <p>But being to effecte that dreadful miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, which before al worldes thou had decreed, thou dideſt exinanite thy ſelf that art the wiſdome, &amp; mind, &amp; word, and Character, and Bound, and Image, and Seale, and Sonne, &amp; expreſſe forme of the Father. For by the holy Ghoſt, thou dideſt both dwel in the chaſt Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, &amp; receaued from her a birth which is aboue al reaſon. For thou dideſt not at al looſe her Virginal clauſures, but as when thou haddeſt not fleſh, thou dideſt enter into her, by ſuch meanes as thou knoweſt: ſo hauing receaued fleſh thou dideſt goe forth of her againe, leauing the doare of her wombe ſhut as it was before.</p>
                  <p>Soone after, thou dideſt vndergoe thy Croſſe, drinking gaule and vinegre mingled together, and pearced through with a ſpeare, thruſt into thy ſide.</p>
                  <p>At the length, freely ſuffering death
